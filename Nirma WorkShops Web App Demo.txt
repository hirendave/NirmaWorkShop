AI-Powered Student Feedback App

Open ChatGPT (or AI tool) live.

Type:
“Generate a responsive HTML page with a student feedback form (Name, Subject, Feedback), styled with CSS”

Next, type another prompt:
“Add JavaScript to capture form input and display it in the feedback section without reloading the page.”

Prompt:
“Modify the JavaScript so that when feedback is submitted, it generates a short 2-line summary and a sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative). Use dummy functions generateSummary(feedback) and generateSentiment(feedback).”

“Style the feedback cards with colors, rounded corners, and sentiment badges (green for positive, red for negative, gray for neutral).”
